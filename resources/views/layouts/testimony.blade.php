<p>My name is Nyaloch Gracious an Alur by tribe aged 18 years currently in s.6, At first i didn't have any hope of joining high school except dreaming of it
until God connected me to an Organisation that changed my life and created motto in me that i can make it.</p>
<p>House of support has been a blessing to my education since my S.4 because i would have not done UNEB 2018, sincerely i would be among the girls on street looking for a living.</p>
<p>Through house of support i am connected to many people that i have never thought of meeting in my life and <strong>All I can say thank you HOUSE OF SUPPORT</strong></p>
