<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>As a founder, the motivation came from my background as not being educated due to several circumstances in the family and financial muscles Hence having a Revelation,one day that i would atleast support a child and he/she attains education so that what i missed i can view it from that child and also helping more who are going through what i went through thus urguing welwishers to join the cause.As a young lady 18 years,having no option God guided me towards helpng the young generation, at that time i became minister in Sunday school giving me chance to interact with different children and challenges they go through.</p>
